### Lab 1: Exploring Node.js Basics

#### Objective:
To enable students to explore the basic concepts of Node.js, including its architecture, modules, and the use of NPM.

### Tasks:
#### Task 1: Installation and Setup
1. Install Node.js and NPM.
2. Verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal.

#### Task 2: Node.js REPL
1. Start the Node.js REPL by running `node` in the terminal.
2. Perform basic arithmetic operations.
3. Declare variables and create functions.

#### Task 3: Node.js Modules
1. Create a ‘mathOperations’ module with functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
2. Import the module in a new file and use its functions to perform various operations.

#### Task 4: NPM Usage
1. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
2. Install any package (e.g., lodash) from NPM.
3. Use a method from the installed package in your project.

#### Deliverables:
1. A screenshot verifying the installation of Node.js and NPM.
2. A JavaScript file using a module created by you, performing various math operations.
3. A Node.js project utilizing an NPM package.

### Lab 2: Deep Dive into Node.js Concepts

#### Objective:
To deepen understanding of advanced Node.js concepts like Event Loop, Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O, Callbacks, and the File System module.

### Tasks:
#### Task 1: Exploring Event Loop
1. Draw a diagram illustrating the Node.js Event Loop.
2. Write a program demonstrating the working of the Event Loop.

#### Task 2: Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O
1. Write two pieces of code to read a file: one using blocking I/O and the other using non-blocking I/O.
2. Observe and note the differences in their executions.

#### Task 3: Callbacks in Action
1. Write a function that reads a file and processes its content using a callback.
2. Handle errors gracefully and print the content of the file to the console.

#### Task 4: Mastering the File System Module
1. Write a program to read a file and print its content to the console using the File System module.
2. Write a program to write some data to a new file.
3. Write a program to list all the files in a directory.

#### Deliverables:
1. A well-commented JavaScript file for each task demonstrating the understanding of each concept.
2. A document containing diagrams, observations, and any additional notes related to each task.
